## How to set up RaspberryPi and SSH
- Download desired img file (Raspian Lite is a good headless OS)
- Plug in MicroSD card to card reader
- Find the name of the MicroSD card
  - `diskutil list`
- Unmount the MicroSD card
  - `diskutil unmountDisk <disk name>`
- Write img to MicroSD card (You may have to install `pv` from homebrew if you don't have it, it just shows your write progress)
  - `pv <img file path> | sudo dd bs=1m of=<disk name>`
- Create your WPA Supplicant config file (find example alongside this README)
  - `vim /Volumes/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf`
- Add ssh file to activate ssh on the pi
  - `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`
- Unmount the MicroSD card
  - `diskutil unmountDisk <disk name>`
- Plug MicroSD card into RaspberryPi and let it run for a few minutes. It will take some time to get the image mounted
- From computer, ping the pi to determine if it is connected to the local network
  - `ping raspberrypi.local`
- If successful, ssh into the pi
  - `ssh pi@<ip provided from ping>`
- The default ssh password is `raspberry`
